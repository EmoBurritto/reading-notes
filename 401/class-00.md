##  Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset

the Power of YET:
- a path into the future 

gives insight into early event of career

PRIME EXAMPLE 401 entrance exam, BOMBED it, and felt terrible for the rets of the course, if I took it as the power of yet it would of helped a ton mentally and allowing me to execute the 301 project and collaborate to the best of my abilities

give 10 year olds an above challenge 

growth mindset
- love challenge 
- ready to develop their abilities 
- hoping to be informative mindset 
- engage deeply with yet 
- process, understand and correct error 

fixed mindset 
- intelligence up for judgement 
- FAILED 
- not buying power of yet 
- tyranny of now 
- some said they'd cheat next time instead of study 
- some looked for other who did worse for comfort 
- run from difficulty 

HUGE part is how we were raised
To this day the phrase my mom would say in numerous emotional ways to me "why A- not A+" haunts me  

the constant need for validation...man that hit hard 

the bridge to yet 
- praise wisely, improvement, engagement 
- rewarding yet, effort, strategy and progress 

the power of yet and not yet
