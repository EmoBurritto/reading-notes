##  Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset

the Power of YET:
- a path into the future 

gives insight into early event of career

PRIME EXAMPLE 401 entrance exam, BOMBED it, and felt terrible for the rets of the course, if I took it as the power of yet it would of helped a ton mentally and allowing me to execute the 301 project and collaborate to the best of my abilities

give 10 year olds an above challenge 

growth mindset
- love challenge 
- ready to develop their abilities 
- hoping to be informative mindset 
- engage deeply with yet 
- process, understand and correct error 

fixed mindset 
- intelligence up for judgement 
- FAILED 
- not buying power of yet 
- tyranny of now 
- some said they'd cheat next time instead of study 
- some looked for other who did worse for comfort 
- run from difficulty 

HUGE part is how we were raised
To this day the phrase my mom would say in numerous emotional ways to me "why A- not A+" haunts me  

the constant need for validation...man that hit hard 

the bridge to yet 
- praise wisely, improvement, engagement 
- rewarding yet, effort, strategy and progress 

the power of yet and not yet

rewarding progress builds perseverance 

reward for pushing out of comfort zone make stronger neuron connections 

growth mindset creates  true equality

by transforming the meaning of effort and difficulty, growth mindset can happen 

doesn't just apply to school, relationships in life as well

don't waste life, growth mindset sets precedence on basic human right, hope

##  Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

transitioning careers is tough 

IQ doesn't equal performance and perseverance 

motivation is key 

IQ is best measured by academics alone, that's it 

how is success defined, from Westpoint to a local spelling bee 

not social intelligence, good luck, IQ 

IT's GRIT

- stamina
- perseverance 
- marathon life not sprint 

income, background is not based on GRIT

no clear answer to how Grit is created 

talent has no correlation to Grit 

Growth mindset has DIRECT correlation to Grit 

FAILURE IS NOT PERMANENT

##  Alain de Botton on Redefining Success.

career crisis is COMMON

no such thing as anxiety, stress free 

Don't be  a Snob- judge a book by its cover 

job snobbery is REAL, by simply asked what do YOU do?

opposite of a snob is the ideal mother, unconditional respect 

emotional rewards connected to materialism 

rewards over materials 

Envy is the enemy of equality 

when you can't relate, their is no envy 

idea of spirit of equality is overshadowed by deep inequality 

Two kinds of self help books:
- Anything is possible 
- how to cope with low self esteem 

meritocracy- you got talent, energy and skill you will make it 

top 1% mentality 

makes failure concrete, permanent 

Don't take it personal 

Don't judge people true value 

Tragedy is a great teaching tool 

YOU CAN't BE SUCCESSFUL AT EVERYTHING, BALANCE

focus on ambition

My emotional Intelligence needs improvement. I am not surprised to see R-M being high due to the years of therapy I have been in and helped me identify myself and grow with my family accordingly. I understand that my S-M needs the most work due to my all or nothing nature. In my wife's words I am a giant snowball, either I have all th emomentum in the world and I am an avalanche or I am melted snow ready for spring to be here.

I am comfortable with my score of needs room for growth. After 301, I have had a short time to reflect on what happened and ultimately move on. I need to have grit to be successful in this course and ultimately learn from my mistakes. I am not one to open up to someone after having an initial bad relationship. However, life is about bouncing back and putting those emotions and biases aside so I need to stay focused on my ambition to start a new career and provide for my family in an environment that is better for me overall in the long run. My family and future holistic health motivates me to preserve and accomplish what I am here to do.
