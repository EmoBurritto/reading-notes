## Questions

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?

“female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.”

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
