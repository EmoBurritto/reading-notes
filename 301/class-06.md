# Readings: NODE.JS

## An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

V8 engine- with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute

JavaScript runtime- enhanced V8 engine with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility method to read JS 

npm install -g jshint to install jshint package globally on computer 

npm -v to find npm version installed 

node -v to find nod eversion installed 

npm init -y to install local node package 

package.jon is JS data 

Node allows JS to run on other languages without switching

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

Main outcomes from pair programming:

Iterative loops

Code reviews

Fast feedback

Error checking and linting 

Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard 

Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer

Why pair program: 

Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary

Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea

Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey

Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful, well structured solution

## Questions

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

Engage Collaboration for sure, I am so knew to this that I take everything to heart and literal to the point it has handicapped me and I need help with critical thinking skills from demos to labs 

3. How does pair programming work?

A synergestic relationship between Driver and Navigator 
## Things I want to Know more about 
- is there a point where node will be obselete like PHP
- promote pair programming and mob programming, I feel the culture of the class has a big impact whether or not to promote this ideaology
