# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

## HTML Text Fundamentals. 

Paragraphs wrapped by the <p></p>

Headings are wrapped by the <h1></h1>

- h1 can go on to h6 or more to make headings smaller 
- h1 title of page 
- h2 chapter 
- h3 subsections

rule of thumb use no more than three heading types, stay in correct order, and h1 is at the top of page

Important to use headings and paragraphs to make it user friendly 

Without headings SEO (Search Engine Optimization) will not run efficently and the computer won't output the page as the coder intended 

Screen reader won't run effectively for user with no proper semantics 

CSS and java script won't run effectively without the proper semantics 

<span> with inline CSS can make something look like h1, but that's extra unnecesary work and the SEO won't read it offically as a title 

<ul> for unorderd lists
