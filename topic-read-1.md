# Markdown

*Like Microsoft Word, Markdown is like a word processor but specifically for GitHub. Its a tricky best but is easily usuable and has a certain language and art to it that with time, will become your best friend.  


## Markdown Basic Syntax

To add a Title use the # in order to make it the main heading. Like HTML, to make correspondings headings like H1 or H2, add a #;for example 
### for the equivalent of H3. 

To create paragraphs, add a line of blank code in between the desired text in order to properly format the prargraph.

For bold text, use three *. For example
***BOLD

For italic text, use a * insert text and end with *. For example: 
*Fancy*

*For a list of ordered items, use 1., 2. 3. 4. accordingly. For example: 
1. test 
2. test 
3. test 
4. test

For an unorderd list of items you can use a - or a single *. For example:
* test 
* test 
- test 
- test
