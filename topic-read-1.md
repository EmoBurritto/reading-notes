# Markdown

*Like Microsoft Word, Markdown is like a word processor but specifically for GitHub. Its a tricky best but is easily usuable and has a certain language and art to it that with time, will become your best friend.*


## Markdown Basic Syntax

To add a Title use the # in order to make it the main heading. Like HTML, to make correspondings headings like H1 or H2, add a #;for example 

### for the equivalent of H3. 

To create paragraphs, add a line of blank code in between the desired text in order to properly format the prargraph.

For bold text, use three * followed by text then three *. For example

***BOLD*** word 

For italic text, use a * insert text and end with *. For example: 

*Fancy*

For a list of ordered items, use 1., 2. 3. 4. accordingly. For example: 

1. test 
2. test 
3. test 
4. test

For an unorderd list of items you can use a - or a single *. For example:

* test 
* test 
- test 
- test 


## Mastering Markdown on GitHub

For bold with an italic word in between the text start with the bold format do italic text then end with bold format; For example ** __ __ **:

**Bold words followed by _italic text_ done**

For images use ![text description of image ](hyper link); For example: 

![This is an image](https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/base-octocat.svg)

## GitHub Pages

Git is the arena and GitHub is the sport. It's a place to colaborately work with others in order to create and add to a repository. It can be public or private. It allows you to see your progress continously and never lose your work. Instead of creating a new file like resume, resume 2, resume updated, etc. It allows to continously work. No database or servers to configure, direct interface. Most commonly used with markdown. You can create a webpage with its master branch and drag and drop files wiht ease. It seems simple enough but does take some time to learn.
