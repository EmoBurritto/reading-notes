*Anatomy of HTML Element:*

*Images consists of:*

1. img src
2. url
3. alt(description of image) 

*Headers consists of H1, H2, H3 accordingly.* +***Don't skip H1 to H4, bad syntax. Will read in error***

*Paragraphs distinguished by p text p.*

*There are two kind os lists: ordered(ol) and unorderd(ul)*
