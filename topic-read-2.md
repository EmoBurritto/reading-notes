# Choosing a Text Editor

When it comes to coding the importance of someone's text editor can not be **emphasised enough**. Some can compare it to their choice of comfort clothing; you know, that sweater that fits just so, highlighting and especially not highlighting our most loving features. Our choice of text editor can help aide the way code with such features as code completion, syntax highlighting, or theme. Code completion is like our automatic go to sweater, just knowing what we are going to get out of the day when it comes to use. Syntax highlighting is like the type of clothing, is it earrings or a hat today? We know what and why we are using  such complementing items. Lastly, we have a theme , do we go for a classic look, something easy on the eyes, or go for it all with that nice suit and dress we have been saving for a nice night out. Regardless of what clothes you choose, the brand is equally important for the brand itself gives you the keys to accessories and complement the outfit as a whole. This is where the text editor comes in. Are we going by default and go with what's given to use or do we try something new and indie and go third party. At the end of the day we have what we have clothes.
