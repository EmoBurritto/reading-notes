# Choosing a Text Editor

*When it comes to coding the importance of someone's text editor can not be **emphasised enough**. Some can compare it to their choice of comfort clothing; you know, that sweater that fits just so, highlighting and especially not highlighting our most loving features. Our choice of text editor can help aide the way code with such features as code completion, syntax highlighting, or theme. Code completion is like our automatic go to sweater, just knowing what we are going to get out of the day when it comes to use. Syntax highlighting is like the type of clothing, is it earrings or a hat today? We know what and why we are using  such complementing items. Lastly, we have a theme , do we go for a classic look, something easy on the eyes, or go for it all with that nice suit and dress we have been saving for a nice night out. Regardless of what clothes you choose, the brand is equally important for the brand itself gives you the keys to accessories and complement the outfit as a whole. This is where the text editor comes in. Are we going by default and go with what's given to use or do we try something new and indie and go third party. At the end of the day we have what we have clothes.*

## The Command Line

*When using a terminal or command line you are directly talking to the computer, an instant ask and recieve line of commmunication. This line of communication usually consists of a series of lines with prompts. Dictating the state of conversation between computer and user. There can be countless lines of commmunication, however there are typically three when a command is given, the shell followed by a command,the result, and the shell again. The shell is like the current location you are in the system, the repository or folder to be exact. A common command when can use is echo, to find out what shell they are in; it's literal echo.*

## Basic Navigation

*PWD, print Working Directory, allows you to identify what directory or repository you are in. Another common command would be ls, listing which directories you are currently in. For example, you might find yourself somewhere deep deep in a directory and feel lost; dont be afraid to shoot that ls fire out and find out exactly where you are. This where you can fidn out if you are in a relative path to your goaL or absolute path; if there's a /, you are absolute if not then you are relative. When in doubt, tab it out and auto complete a command to find your way back. 

## About Files

*A file is what it sounds, a colection of information. When accessing a terminal, you can use commands like ls a- in order to list all files under set directory or single file. Under linux, an operting system you can find all files or infromation on your computer. However, as flexible and custom linux can by using extension systems, capitalization is key. For example, if you had a file named Jazz and jazz, you can fidn yourself looking at information on the Utah Jazz basketball team or a playlist of jazz music. Also never use spaces when trying to create a file, if you must, just put quotations up and you're good; "Utah Jazz".*
