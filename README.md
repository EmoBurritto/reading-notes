# Food For Thought: Notes for Class 102

*Hello There! My name is Jose Gonzalez, my pronouns are He/Him, and I'm currently stationed with my family at Hickham AFB in Honolulu, HI. I recently left the Army in May 2022, completing about 9 years in the Army by being a truck driver for three years and dialysis nurse for 6 years. I have no experience with computers, however my wife is in intel and has convinced me to switch careers. I have been married for 6 years with a 4 year old girl and another girl due in August. I am from Los Angeles, CA. I'm using a windows 11 home computer version 21H2 for this course. I'm excited for this class to start a new career and start my civilian life.*

## The Ultimate Battle: Growth mindset 

*The ability to consistently adapt and overcome any and all obstacles life throws at you is the basis of a growth mindset; now of course that is easier said than done. Frist of, consistency is needed in order to develop and practice a sound growth mindset. It's like a habit, if you pick and choose your battles and when to apply, your really just hurting yourself. No work gets done due to our great frenemy, procrastonation. Now once you have the consistency and motivation to try and try again with a positive outlook, progress can be made. Now, there's no need to reinvent the wheel, the art of choosing when to engage, rest and ultimately utilize all resources, is the trickster we all stumble upon. Ultimately, by adapting to all sitations accordingly, postive actions can be executed; thus. resulting in the overcoming of set obstacle. So take a rest, reflect and reengage because life is always ready to throw another obstacle at you, whether your ready or not. 

### Reminders to stay in a growth mindset:
1. Positive minds yield positive results
2. Create SMART Goals: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound
3. Rest, Reflect, Reengage: consistency is key
