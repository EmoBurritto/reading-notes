# Coding Fellows

*Hello There! My name is Jose Gonzalez, my pronouns are He/Him, and I'm currently stationed with my family at Hickham AFB in Honolulu, HI. I recently left the Army in May 2022, completing about 9 years in the Army by being a truck driver for three years and dialysis nurse for 6 years. I have no experience with computers, however my wife is in intel and has convinced me to switch careers. I have been married for 6 years with a 4 year old girl and another girl due in August. I am from Los Angeles, CA. I'm using a windows 11 home computer version 21H2 for this course. I'm excited for this class to start a new career and start my civilian life.*
