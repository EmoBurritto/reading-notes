# My Reading Notes Journal!

*This is where I'm going to write my reading notes*

## Growth mindset is my own perception of my abilities. I can keep improving with determnation, preserverance, practice etc. 

### Reminders to stay in a growth mindset:
1. Sucking at something's the first step to bein' sorta good at something 
2. Put your mask on first, you can't help others if you don't take of yourself. 
3. Whenever I'm struggling, remember no one else is walking in my shoes. Thi sis MY journey!
4. Try to focus on what's possible, not excuses. We can always find reasons.
